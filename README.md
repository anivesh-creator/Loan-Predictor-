## 🧠 How It Works

### Data Generation
Creates 500 fake loan applicants
↓
Each with 5 features: salary, credit score, loan amount, job years, debt
↓
Applies realistic approval rules


### Model Training
Splits data: 80% training (400), 20% testing (100)
↓
Trains Random Forest Classifier (100 decision trees)
↓
Each tree votes: approve or reject
↓
Majority wins → Final decision


### Prediction
User enters 5 details
↓
Normalize values (same scale as training)
↓
Pass through 100 trees
↓
Trees vote (e.g., 87 approve, 13 reject)
↓
Result: Approved with 87% confidence
↓
Display reasons why


### Why Random Forest?

Think of it as **100 smart experts voting**:

- **Expert 1:** "Is credit score > 700?"
- **Expert 2:** "Is salary > ₹80,000?"
- **Expert 3:** "Is loan < ₹30,00,000?"
- ... (97 more experts)

**Final Decision:** Majority vote = Result

**Why this works:** 100 experts rarely all wrong!

## 📊 Model Performance

### Accuracy
- **Overall Accuracy:** 96.0%
- **Meaning:** Out of 100 predictions, 96 are correct

### Feature Importance

Which factors matter most for approval?

| Factor | Importance |
|--------|-----------|
|  Credit Score | 35% (Most important!) |
|  Monthly Salary | 28% |
|  Loan Amount | 20% |
|  Job Years | 12% |
|  Existing Debt | 5% (Least important) |

**Insight:** Credit score + salary = 63% of decision
